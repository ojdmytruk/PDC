Preface
Secondary vocational–technical education programs in Mississippi are faced with many challenges resulting from
sweeping educational reforms at the national and state levels. Schools and teachers are increasingly being held
accountable for providing true learning activities to every student in the classroom. This accountability is measured
through increased requirements for mastery and attainment of competency as documented through both
formative and summative assessments.

The courses in this document reflect the statutory requirements as found in Section 37-3-49, Mississippi Code of
1972, as amended (Section 37-3-46). In addition, this curriculum reflects guidelines imposed by federal and state
mandates (Laws, 1988, ch. 487, §14; Laws, 1991, ch. 423, §1; Laws, 1992, ch. 519, §4 eff. from and after July 1,
1992; Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act IV, 2007; and No Child Left Behind Act of 2001).

Unit Number and Title

Suggested Time on Task
An estimated number of clock hours of instruction that should be required to teach the competencies and
objectives of the unit. A minimum of 140 hours of instruction is required for each Carnegie unit credit. The
curriculum framework should account for approximately 75–80% of the time in the course.

Competencies and Suggested Objectives
A competency represents a general concept or performance that students are expected to master as a
requirement for satisfactorily completing a unit. Students will be expected to receive instruction on all
competencies. The suggested objectives represent the enabling and supporting knowledge and performances that
will indicate mastery of the competency at the course level.

Suggested Teaching Strategies
This section of each unit indicates research-based strategies that can be used to enable students to master each
competency. Emphasis has been placed on strategies that reflect active learning methodologies. Teachers should
feel free to modify or enhance these suggestions based on needs of their students and resources available in order
to provide optimum learning experiences for their students.

Suggested Assessment Strategies
This section indicates research-based strategies that can be used to measure student mastery. Examples of
suggested strategies could include rubrics, class participation, reflection, and journaling. Again, teachers should
feel free to modify or enhance these suggested assessment strategies based on local needs and resources.

Integrated Academic Topics, 21st Century Skills and Information and Communication Technology Literacy
Standards, ACT College Readiness Standards, and Technology Standards for Students
This section identifies related academic topics as required in the Subject Area Testing Program (SATP) in Algebra I,
Biology I, English II, and U.S. History from 1877, which are integrated into the content of the unit. Research-based
teaching strategies also incorporate ACT College Readiness standards. This section also identifies the 21st Century
Skills and Information and Communication Technology Literacy skills. In addition, national technology standards for
students associated with the competencies and suggested objectives for the unit are also identified.

References
A list of suggested references is provided for each unit. The list includes some of the primary instructional
resources that may be used to teach the competencies and suggested objectives. Again, these resources are
suggested, and the list may be modified or enhanced based on needs and abilities of students and on available
resources.

Competency 1: Outline the physical and logical aspects of a local area network (LAN), and then plan and construct
              a LAN. ND1 ND2 ND3 ND4
Suggested Enduring Understandings                                               Suggested Essential Questions
  1. A local area network (LAN) is made up of                                     1. What factors would determine the appropriate
     hardware and software components and provides                                   topologies and protocols to be deployed on a
     interconnectivity between PC users, printers,                                   LAN?
     servers, and external networks in a limited,                                 2. What are some common hardware devices and
     defined geographic area such as an office building                              software typically used on a LAN?
     or school campus.                                                            3. What are some considerations when designing a
  2. A LAN can be segmented into smaller units called                                network with regard to the use of network
     subnets.                                                                        addressing and subnetting?
  3. Servers running network operating systems (NOS)
     typically are used on LANs to provide login
     authentication services, security, file sharing, e-
     mail, and printing services.

Suggested Enduring Understandings                                              Suggested Essential Questions
  1. An effective security policy should include                                 1. How much security is enough to reasonably
     software protection, physical network security,                                safeguard a network from common security
     and efforts to educate network users in matters of                             breaches and vulnerabilities?
     password management and social engineering                                  2. What are some considerations when developing
     threats.                                                                       a security plan?
  2. Wireless networks are inherently less secure than                           3. Why do some businesses’ networks require
     wired networks and are banned from use from                                    more security than others?
     some networks such as those used in the banking                             4. In what ways has the Internet made network
     industry.                                                                      security more difficult to achieve and maintain?
                                                                                 5. Why should networks containing sensitive data
                                                                                    avoid using wireless networking?

                                 Have each student use concept mapping software
                                 to develop a timeline that shows the history of the
                                 Internet, markup languages, and Web design.

                                 or poorly designed. Call on students to provide
                                 suggestions for improving poorly designed sites.

                                 Have students work in teams to develop a checklist
                                 to be used for evaluating a Web site. Have each
                                 student use a search engine to locate two Web
                                 sites—one that could be considered a well-
                                 designed site and one that could be considered a
                                 poorly designed site. Have each student use the
                                 team checklist to evaluate each of the selected
                                 Web sites and present his or her findings to the
                                 class.

                                 Have students work individually to re-create one of
                                 the poorly designed Web sites into a well-designed
                                 Web site.
